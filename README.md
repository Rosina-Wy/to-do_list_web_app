# to-do_list_web_app
A project created in 2-3 working days. I developed the small application after 2 days of classes where I was first introduced to the programming languages used. 
Sql database on local environment with Xampp. You can find sql file on repository. Sql file also contains username and password options as the application does no allow users to create accounts at this stage. 
A simple web app with a to-do list function, allowing users to create, save, cross out or delete completed list items.
